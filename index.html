            Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the
            charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too.
            Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support
            causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on
            their own lives.

            Help end hunger in communities across Bangladesh. Many people in our
            communities are struggling through hardship and unable to provide
            food to their families. Food for Families ensures that as few as
            possible go to bed hungry each night./p>

            While Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in poverty reduction,
            one in four people is still living in poverty, according to the
            World Bank group.The capital Dhaka is the most crowded city in the
            world with 41,000 people per square kilometer.

          <p>
            According to UNICEF, 40% of Bangladesh's population is children and
            statistics indicate that 600,000 are out of school. To contribute to
            increased enrolment, we have forged partnerships in Bangladesh and
            are currently working on four project programs.

      many are seeking refuge within shelters. Access to food and clean drinking
